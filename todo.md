# BUGS
- [x] When reading a string field with `get` instead of `get_data`, the program crashes. (Although other fields work fine with `get`, even char arrays), apparently it didn't exist in the first place....

# FEATURES
- [x] Add Arduino boards support:
  - [x] tuple implementation
  - [x] EEPROM implementation
  - [x] Tested on Arduino UNO
