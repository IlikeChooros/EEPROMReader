# BUGS
- [x] When reading a string field with `get` instead of `get_data`, the program crashes. (Although other fields work fine with `get`, even char arrays), apparently it didn't exist in the first place....

# FEATURES
- [ ] Add Arduino boards support:
  - [ ] tuple implementation
  - [ ] EEPROM implementation
